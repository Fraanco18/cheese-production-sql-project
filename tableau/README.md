## 🎯 Dashboard Purpose

The Tableau dashboard aims to answer the core analytical questions of the project:

- How has U.S. cheese production evolved over time?
- Which states dominate national production?
- How concentrated is production geographically?
- How does total production compare across multi-year periods?

The dashboard focuses on **clarity, hierarchy, and business relevance**, prioritizing insights over decorative complexity.
