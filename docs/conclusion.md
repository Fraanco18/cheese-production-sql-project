# 📌 Conclusion

This project provides a structured, end-to-end analysis of U.S. cheese production trends using SQL and Tableau, transforming raw historical data into actionable insights.

The analysis confirms that U.S. cheese production has followed a **long-term upward trajectory**, demonstrating resilience even during periods of significant disruption such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While total production increased notably in recent years, **geographic concentration and seasonal patterns remained largely stable**, indicating structural consistency within the industry.

From a technical perspective, the project highlights the importance of:
- careful data cleaning and validation
- understanding changes in reporting methodology over time
- transparent handling of missing or incomplete data

Overall, this case study demonstrates how well-documented SQL workflows combined with clear visual storytelling can support reliable, reproducible analysis and informed decision-making in real-world contexts.
